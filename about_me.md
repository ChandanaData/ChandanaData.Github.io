Hi there! Iâ€™m Chandana, a seasoned Programmer Analyst with extensive experience working with SQL, Java, JavaScript, Oracle Reports Builder and SDLC. 
Having spent several years in IT field, Iâ€™ve developed a strong foundation in problem-solving, critical thinking, and technical skills.

Data has always been my jam, and my previous stint as a Data Analyst at a Pharma company helped me build a solid foundation in data analysis, 
data visualization, and programming. I'm super pumped to pivot my career to the Data field now! I am excited about the potential opportunities in the 
Data field (esp. in Healthcare/Pharmaceuticals) and look forward to applying my skills and experience to make a significant impact.

When I am not working, I love traveling ðŸš˜ and exploring new cultures. I also enjoy reading books ðŸ“– that challenge my perspectives. 
If you share these interests or are passionate about data, let's connect and chat!
